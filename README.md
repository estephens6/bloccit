## Bloccit: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails.

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

To load rails server: :
# rails s -p $PORT -b $IP

db migrate commands

rake db:migrate:status

RAILS_ENV=development bundle exec rake db:migrate:reset

rake db:abort_if_pending_migrations
